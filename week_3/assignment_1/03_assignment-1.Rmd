# Instructions

## Submission 

Please knit your file as a **Word Document** and submit your assignment to **Gradescope**.

## Tips 

  - Please make sure to double check that your code does not run off the page in your knitted **Word Document**. To fix this issue, go back to your code, and add new lines in your code by hitting enter so that part of the code chunk is on another line. 

## Data

Throughout **Assignment 1**, we will be using data on hotel bookings from two hotels - Hotel 1 is a resort hotel and Hotel 2 is a city hotel from this file `hotel_bookings.csv`.

\newpage 

## PART 0 [Ungraded]

### Perform Copy and Rename

Create a copy of this file to use for your exercise using `Save As` and name the copy as follows `03_assignment-1.Rmd` -> `03_assignment-1-firstname_lastname.Rmd`. 

### YAML `week` Parameter

Create a `week` object in your environment by pulling in the week parameter from the `YAML` (Hint - use `$`).

```{r}
# Type your answer here
```

### Read in Data

Load in the `here` package and use it to read in `hotel_bookings.csv` from the `PHW251B/week_3/data`. Name the dataframe `data`. Then output the names of the columns in the dataframe using the `names` function. 

```{r}
# Type your answer here
```

### Clean Names

Load in the `janitor` package and use the `clean_names` function to clean the column names. Overwrite the dataframe `data` called `data`. Then output the names of the columns in the dataframe using the `names` function. The names should now be in **snake_case**!

```{r}
# Type your answer here
```

## PART 1

### Question 1

We would like you to explore the dataset further and create a barchart of your choice (i.e. basic/regular, stacked, or grouped) and following the principles of good graphical design. We recommend you use this as an opportunity to step out of your comfort zone and try creating a barchart you haven't yet explored or trying out other modifications.

Most of the Variables are Self-Explanatory with the exception of a few:

  -`lead_time`: The number of days between arrival date and date when booking was entered into the system
  
  -`country`: Country of Origin; Country name documented in ISO3 codes
  
  -`is_repeated_guest`: 0 = No, 1 = Yes
  
  -`agent` or `company`: ID of Travel Agency or Company; NULL is not a missing value, rather it means "Not applicable" (in other words the booking was not from a travel agent/company)
  
  -`adr`: Average Daily Rate of the Hotel


```{r}
#Your Code

```

\newpage 

### Question 2

Please explain the variables you chose to explore and the type of barchart you created and your reasons for doing so. (2 - 5 sentences)


YOUR ANSWER HERE


\newpage 

### Question 3

Please comment on your design choices (i.e. color, other modifications). Was there a certain color scheme you chose and why you chose that? How does that impact your visualization? What other modifications did you make and how do you think those contribute to good graphical design?  (5 - 10 sentences)

## PART 2

### Question 4

Recreate the graph below with the "ggplot" package

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(here(week, "assignment_1", "03_barchart.png"))
```
