**A NOTE FROM THE INSTRUCTORS** - It is highly recommended that you watch `Module 0: Orientation` in Week 1 because parts of this `RMarkdown` file have been updated from the accompanying video to elevate your learning experience. Essentially, we replaced BaseR functions with the equivalent functions from the `tidyverse`, added the use of `Rprojects` and the `here` package for referencing and importing data, and the introduced the `clean_names` function from the `janitor` package. We did this because we wanted to better align our course with industry best practices for both efficiency and robustness. Therefore, the code that you may see in the recording may be slightly different than the code in the `R Markdown` file, however it accomplishes the same thing with better methodologies :)

# Part 1

## Introduction

This `R Markdown` (or `.Rmd`) is a brief review of R programming basics using the `dplyr` (and greater `tidyverse` collection) library for data wrangling and cleaning, and is the first of a series of review modules for `PHW251B: Data Visualization for Public Health`. Students are assumed to have completed some coursework in R, including but not limited to `PH142` and/or `PHW251`. If any wording or concepts are less familiar, please feel free to review said courses. It is highly recommended that you watch 

## Objectives

This module intends to provide the user review with these data concepts in R:

- Reading in and saving datasets
- Explore data with `head` to preview and `unique` to find distinct values
- Subsetting **rows** conditionally with `filter`
- Subsetting **columns** conditionally with `select`
- Creating new variables with `mutate`
- Conditional mutates with `if_else` and `case_when`
- Cleaning column names with `clean_names`

## Optional additional resources

Of particular alignment to this review markdown includes:

- PH142: Lecture 2 (Working with Data in R and RStudio (`dplyr`)) <https://ph142-ucb.github.io/fa21/course-schedule/>

For review of R and programming basics, these will be helpful to review:

- PHW251: Weeks 1, 4, 5, and 6
- R4DS (<https://r4ds.had.co.nz/>): Chapter 5

A note before we begin! You'll see throughout these .rmds that text will have different appearances based on some characters that surround them. Here's a quick overview of these characters and how they correspondingly change the appearance of text within them once the .rmd is knit (created into a document). These formats are based off of Markdown/HTML language:

# Header 1 
## Header 2
### Header 3

*Italicized*

**Bolded**

***Bolded and italicized***

_Italicized_

`Typefont`

We will be using each format for emphasize different variables, file formats, coding conventions, or other points of interest.

# Part 2

## tidyverse

Now we are going to load the `tidyverse` library, which is a collection of tried-and-true data science libraries that work well together (`ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `readr`, `purrr`, `tibble`, `stringr`, `forcats`, `lubridate`) and are now going to be available in your sessions environment for the remainder of the R Markdown file. You will have to do this with every library that you want to use in a given script or Markdown file. You can find documenation for `tidyverse` functions here <https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/>.

```{r load tidyverse, message=F, warning=F}
# Load tidyverse library 
library(tidyverse)
```

Of useful reference is the `dplyr` "cheatsheet", which is a handy reference to the most popular usages of the package: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/data-transformation.pdf>

You can check out other R cheatsheets here: <https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/>

## Reading in data

Data will be available in many formats, and will need to be read into R and wrangled before it is visualized. Most data will be represented in some form of tabular data (tabular = table, where there are rows and columns), where rows are different observations and columns are different variables, or features. 
Popular tabular formats you may see in R - 

- csv (comma separated values)
- tsv (tab separated values)
- xls, xlsx (Excel files)
- rdata, rds
- and others!

In the code chunk below, we will be reading in data from the California Open Data portal. Open data is public data collected by the state through its routine business activities and published in a format that is easy to search, easy to download and easy to combine with other data sets from other sources; it does not include private or confidential data about individuals. 

We will use the `read_csv` function from `tidyverse's` `readr` package to read in the `asthma.csv` dataset. 

[**NOTE** - this part of the module has been updated from the video in the course. We essentially replaced this complicated `rename_with(~ tolower(gsub(" ","_", .x, fixed=TRUE)))` code with `clean_names`. We also removed the part of the code where you read in data directly from a website because that link was no longer available and are providing you with just static copy of the `asthma.csv` dataset instead.]

`clean_names` from the `janitor` package standardizes data-frame column names so theyâ€™re safe, consistent, and easy to work with. It lowercases names, converts spaces/hyphens/punctuation to underscores, removes/normalizes special characters (e.g., accents), collapses multiple separators, trims leading/trailing underscores, and guarantees uniqueness by appending numeric suffixes if needed.

```{r reading in files}
# Load 
library(janitor)
library(here)

# Pull in the appropriate `week` parameter from YAML
week <- params$week

# Import raw file
asthma_raw <- read_csv(here(week, "data", "asthma.csv")) 

# Output column names for raw dataset
names(asthma_raw)

# Import same file and pipe it through clean_names() [This is a best practice]
asthma <- read_csv(here(week, "data", "asthma.csv")) %>% clean_names() # Using `clean_names` instead of `rename_with(~ tolower(gsub(" ","_", .x, fixed=TRUE)))`

# Output column names cleaned dataset
names(asthma)
```

[**NOTE** - this part of the module has also been slightly updated from the video in the course. We essentially got rid of the dialogue about absolute vs relative path because for this course everything is relative to the **R Project** - `PHW251B.Rproj` via the `here` function]

Reading in files is simple and just requires some knowledge of the location of your folder. Note that the dataset location above is in relation to the location of your **R Project** - `PHW251B.Rproj` which we specify with `here` as we discussed in `Module 0: Orientation`. Then we just point to the `data` folder and then to the `asthma.csv` file itself.

```{r preview files}
# Preview dataset
head(asthma)
```

First, we'll explore the stratifications and then review some ways to subset and filter our dataset based on conditions we set. 

What are the unique vales in the "years", "strata", and "age_group" variables? The first is done for you, and returns the unique values in the dataset _asthma_ and its variable _year_.

```{r explore data}

?unique

unique(asthma$years)

unique(asthma$strata)

unique(asthma$age_group)

```

Note that there's some interesting formatting appearing in the unique values that may require reformatting/cleaning if we want to present it, or simply analyze it without having to type in longer-winded formats. Upon review, it seems as if "x96" may represent "-". We'll create some new variables that have cleaner values later.

# Part 3

## Creating new columns

First, let's create some new continuous variables that are calculations from other continuous variables using the `mutate` function from the `dplyr` package. To start, let's find the approximate population at risk from the number of deaths and age-adjusted mortality rate variables. Note that the reported rate is per 1,000,000 residents.

$$
mortalityrate = \frac{deaths}{population  at risk}
$$
$$
population at risk = \frac{deaths}{mortality rate}
$$

```{r mutations}
#The first line assigns the new changes to a *new dataset*
data <- asthma %>%
  mutate(population = (number_of_deaths/age_adjusted_mortality_rate)*1000000)
  
#Preview the data, or take the "head" of the dataset
head(data)
```

Note that the population sizes look a bit off -- perhaps too big? This is likely because these were totaled over three year spans (e.g. 2014-2016). If we divide the total population by 3, it approximates the state's current population of ~40 million.

Of course, one can apply any mathematical operations when mutating continuous data (+, -, /, *, ^, etc.). We demonstrate different operations below, which can all be brought into a mutate statement (with the ability to replace numbers with variables as seen before).

```{r maths}
#Addition
1+2

#Subtraction
3-2

#Multiplication
2*5

#Division
13/2

#Modulus, or remainder after division
13%%2

#Exponents
2^2
```

Knowing that these are totals over three years, we can get the yearly average by dividing the number of deaths by three.  Try it on your own now, assigning the new variable to `avg_deaths` adding it within the existing `data` dataset.

```{r mutations 2}
# Solution
data <- data %>% #note that we use the old dataset to inform the new one
  mutate(avg_deaths = number_of_deaths/3)
```

### Creating Columns with Conditional Logic

[ **NOTE** - This sections of the RMarkdown file has been updated from the accompanying video where we replaced BaseR functions with `dplyr` functions to elevate your learning experience. It is best practice in industry to use the `tidyverse`/`dplyr` equivalents for BaseR functions if they are available. This is because it better supports `tidyverse` workflows with the `%>%` operator and runs faster when working with big data :) ]

#### if_else

One of the more powerful tools in the `dplyr/tidyverse` is how we can chain together functions to create new variables conditionally based on a data condition. In this case, the `NAs` (data not available) and `NaNs` (not a number) are pesky and should both be `NAs` for sake of data cleanliness. Say we want to modify our existing `population` variable to reflect this. We can use the function `if_else` from the `dplyr` package to help us do so! 

(Remember, you can see more documentation for a function by typing in `?function()` in the console)

```{r if_else}
# Help page for dplyr's type-stable conditional
?dplyr::if_else

# Plain-English pattern for beginners:
# if_else(<test>, <value if TRUE>, <value if FALSE>)
# Note: The TRUE and FALSE values must be the same type (all numeric, or all character, etc.).

# What weâ€™re doing in this chunk:
# 1) Clean `population` by turning any NaN ("Not a Number", e.g., from 0/0) into a regular missing value (NA).
#    - We use NA_real_ (a numeric NA) so the column stays numeric.
# 2) Add a simple flag `missing` that says "Yes" if `population` is NA and "No" otherwise.
#    - `is.nan()` finds NaN specifically; `is.na()` finds all missing values (including NaN).

data <- data %>%
  mutate(
    # If a value in `population` is NaN, replace it with a numeric NA; otherwise keep the original value
    population = if_else(is.nan(population), true = NA_real_, false = population)
  )

# Quick check: after the replacement, how many NaNs are left? (Should be 0)
sum(is.nan(data$population))

data <- data %>%
  mutate(
    # Create a beginner-friendly missingness flag
    # In plain words: if `population` is NA, mark "Yes"; if not, mark "No"
    missing = if_else(is.na(population), true = "Yes", false = "No")
  )
```

### case_when

A similar and more flexible method for conditionally creating variables is with the `case_when` function from the `dplyr` package, which can allow more than two conditions and two resulting values.

We are also going to deploy a few more functions in our workflow here 
  - The `summarize` function from the `dplyr` package which aggregates many rows into one or a few summary values (like means or medians) per group or for the whole dataset.
  - The `quantile` function, a native baseR function, computes percentiles (e.g., 25th, 50th/median, 75th) of a numeric vector, with `na.rm = TRUE` to ignore missing values.
  - The `pull` function from the `dplyr` package extracts a single column from a data frame/tibble as a plain vector, handy for saving a summarized value into a variable.

In this next exercise, we will examine the spread of values for the age-adjusted mortality rate among those 18+. Then, we will assign a variable `severity` according to if a county belongs to the <25th, <50th, <75th, and 100th percentile of mortality rate values.

```{r case when}
# 1) FILTER to adults only
#    - Keep only rows where age_group equals "18+ years"
#    - This ensures all later calculations (quantiles, labels) are based on the adult subset
data_adult <- data %>%
  filter(age_group == "18+ years")

# 2) COMPUTE QUARTILES (25th, 50th/median, 75th) of the adult age-adjusted mortality rate
#    - quantile() (base R stats) calculates percentiles of a numeric vector
#    - na.rm = TRUE tells quantile() to ignore missing values (NA) so they don't distort results
#    - summarize() + pull() returns a single numeric (a scalar) for each percentile
p_25 <- data_adult %>%
  summarize(val = quantile(age_adjusted_mortality_rate, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  pull(val)

p_50 <- data_adult %>%
  summarize(val = quantile(age_adjusted_mortality_rate, 0.50, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  pull(val)

p_75 <- data_adult %>%
  summarize(val = quantile(age_adjusted_mortality_rate, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  pull(val)

# (Optional) INSPECT one of the saved thresholds to confirm its value.
p_25

# TIP (not executed here): read the help for case_when() in the console
# ?dplyr::case_when

# 3) LABEL SEVERITY using case_when()
#    - case_when() checks conditions from top to bottom; the first TRUE condition wins
#    - We handle missing rates first so those rows remain missing (NA) in the label
#    - Threshold logic -
#        rate < p_25  -> "Low"
#        rate < p_50  -> "Medium"  (this line only runs if the first wasn't TRUE)
#        rate < p_75  -> "Severe"
#        otherwise    -> "Very severe" (i.e., rate >= p_75)
data_adult <- data_adult %>%
  mutate(
    severity = case_when(
      is.na(age_adjusted_mortality_rate)  ~ NA_character_,  # keep missing as missing
      age_adjusted_mortality_rate < p_25  ~ "Low",
      age_adjusted_mortality_rate < p_50  ~ "Medium",
      age_adjusted_mortality_rate < p_75  ~ "Severe",
      TRUE                                ~ "Very severe"    # catch-all for >= p_75
    )
  )

# 4 - PREVIEW the result
#    - Show just the numeric rate and the new severity label, using tail() to peek at the last rows
tail(
  data_adult %>% select(age_adjusted_mortality_rate, severity)
)


```

# Part 4 - Subsetting

## Subsetting ROWS by condition with filter

Some of the most fundamental parts of data cleaning require us to subset, or subdivide our dataset into smaller pieces given that it belongs to some group or has some matching attribute.

We can select observations, or rows, by condition using the `filter` function from the `dplyr` package, where observations will remain in the dataset if it matches a condition you set.

Some things that can help when filtering:

- "x == y", equality operator, so this statement is saying _x should "equal" y_.

- "x == y | x == z", the vertical line | (below the backspace/delete button) is equivalent to "OR". The statement should then mean that _x should equal y OR z_.

- "x == y & x == z", as it implies, the observation must match both conditions. The statement should then mean that _x should equal y AND z_.

[UPDATE in TIPS & TRICKS]
- `%in%` vs == for multiple matches. Use == when comparing a column to one value; use %in% when comparing to several values in vector format c().


```{r filter, warning=F, message=F}
# Here we start with filtering practice. This first line will ask for rows that have Low severity
data_adult %>%
  filter(severity == "Low")

# Here we take another step and want to filter for either Low or Medium using %in% because we are filtering using more than 1 value
data_adult %>%
  filter(severity %in% c("Low", "Medium"))

# What would the filter function look like if we wanted counties with Low severity and for the 2014-2016 time period?
data_adult %>%
  filter(severity == "Low" & str_detect(string = years, pattern = "2014"))

# This will be covered more in-depth in later modules, but here we use a function called "str_detect", or "string detect", that looks into the "years" column for any strings that match "2014". If it detects "2014", it will return true. Therefore, the filter will look for rows that match both severity == "Low" AND having a string in year that includes "2014".

# What arguments to the filter function would we make if we wanted counties with Low OR medium severity? Assign this to a dataset called "temp"
temp <- data_adult %>%
  filter(severity == "Low" | severity == "Medium")
```

Sometimes it's easier to specify one condition that you **do NOT** want to match instead of all of the conditions that you do want to match. For example, it's easier to say that you want all observations that **do NOT** match "Very severe" rather than specify that you want Low, Medium, and Severe. In R, we can use the "!=" to specify an inequality operator.

```{r filter 2, warning=F, message=F}
temp <- data_adult %>%
  filter(severity != "Very severe")

head(temp)
```

## Subsetting COLUMNS by condition with select

Now that we have covered rows, we can review subsetting entire columns, or variables using the `select` function from the `dplyr` package. This is useful when you only want to keep relevant columns from large datasets. This can simplify analyses or just make the datasets more portable. In the case of data visualizations, subsetting columns are usually a necessity, especially when it comes to printing tables (and less so for graphics themselves). 

Like before, we can simply select columns for subsetting by conditions, which is often more straightforward than rows (because we can use column names or numbers).

```{r select, warning=F, message=F}
#Select variables associated with county,  and severity from data_adult dataframe and assign to a new dataframe
new <- data_adult %>%
  select(comment, county, severity)

#Select the same variables, but using each variable's respective number 

new <- data_adult %>%
  select(1, 5, 9)


#Select columns from years to comment. This can be done with the ":" operator

#First way, by name
new <- data_adult %>%
  select(years:comment)

#Second way, by number of column
new <- data_adult %>%
  select(2:7)

```

What if you just want to subset every other column except for one (or a "select" few)? There's a similar method to the inequality operator seen being used with the filter statements. For select methods, we can simply put a "-" (dash) in front of the columns we **don't** want. The subset will then include every column except for the ones in the select statement.

```{r select 2, warning=F, message=F}

#make a copy of the data_adult dataset, just without the "comment" variable
data_adult_clean <- data_adult %>%
  select(-comment)

#check the variable/column names of the new dataset
names(data_adult_clean)


data_adult_clean <- data_adult %>%
  select(-c(comment, strata))
```

## Exercises

Now let's bring it all together! Let's use a series of `mutate`, `filter`, and `select` to create streamlined datasets from our original asthma mortality data. We'll also be using `str_detect` that we saw in the filter section. As always, if you want more information about a function, feel free to look up the documentation with `?function`.

This section will also be a brief look into/review on how to "chain" functions using the **pipe operator**, as explored in the beginning of this module. If you would like more clarity on the pipe operator after this module, here's a helpful blog post on it: <https://www.analyticssteps.com/blogs/using-pipe-operator-simplify-your-code-r-programming>

For our first exercise, let's create a new dataset that includes data for all years and is of those 0-17 years in age. We are most interested in the county, number of deaths, population, and mortality rate. So, our data steps may look similar to the following steps.

- Make a copy of the original data (new_data <- old data)
- Optional: Clean the year text so they are more legible
- Filter for the relevant age group
- Select relevant columns

```{r exercises, message=F, warning=F}
#Call documentation for str_detect function
?str_detect

eg1 <- data %>%
  mutate(years = ifelse(test = str_detect(string = years, pattern ="2014"), 
                        yes = "2014-2016", 
                        no = "2017-2019")) %>%
  filter(str_detect(string = age_group, pattern = "17")) %>%
  select(county, number_of_deaths, population, age_adjusted_mortality_rate)


head(eg1)
```

Now, try making a new dataset called `ex2` that is a copy of the original dataset, with the following changes:

- Has a new column called `populous` that has values `Yes` if the population variable is equal or greater than 100,000 and `No` if the population is less than 100,000. Remember that R can use comparison operators like (>, <, =>, =<, etc.). The function `ifelse` may be useful

- Has clean `year` and `age-group` values (clean it such that the error characters no longer exist). The functions `str_detect` and `ifelse` may be useful

- Filter the dataset the remove rows where there are any `NA` values in mortality rate OR population variable (this means that you want to keep rows where BOTH columns have real, non-NA numbers)

- Select any combination of columns that you would want to report on if you were exploring asthma mortality in California (no wrong answers)!

```{r exercises 2, message=F, warning=F}

eg2 <- data %>%
  mutate(populous = ifelse(test = population >= 100000,
                           yes = "Yes",
                           no = "No"),
         years = ifelse(test = str_detect(string = years, pattern = "2014"),
                       yes = "2014-2016",
                       no = "2017-2019"),
         age_group = case_when(str_detect(string = age_group, pattern = "All ages") ~ "All ages",
                               str_detect(string = age_group, pattern = "17") ~ "0-17 years",
                               str_detect(string = age_group, pattern = "18") ~ "18+ years")
         ) %>%
  filter(is.na(age_adjusted_mortality_rate) == F & is.na(population) == F) %>%
  select(-comment)


eg2 <- data %>%
  mutate(populous = ifelse(population >= 100000, "Yes", "No"),
         years = ifelse(str_detect(years, "2014"), "2014-2016", "2017-2019"),
         age_group = ifelse(str_detect(age_group, "17"), "0-17 years", "18+ years")) %>%
  filter(is.na(age_adjusted_mortality_rate) == F & is.na(population) == FALSE) %>%
  select(- comment)

```

Congratulations! You've reached the end of module 1! You can knit this module and keep it for reference, or continue experimenting with R and `dplyr` tools.
