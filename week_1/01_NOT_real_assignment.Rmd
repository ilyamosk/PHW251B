# NOT Real Assignment! 

This is a fake assignment to just show you the process for saving a copy of your Rmd files for `exercises` and `assignments`.

When you begin to work on `exercises` and `assignments` you *must* save a copy of with a suffix of your name. Here is a sample of the pattern eg `01_NOT_real_assignment.Rmd` - > `01_NOT_real_assignment_ilya_moskalenko.Rmd`. **This is very important!** This is going to protect your work from being overwritten if we push any changes to the course & also assist us with identifying your work!
